MySQL Maven Plugin for Integration Testing

  Check {{{http://www.yegor256.com/2014/05/21/mysql-maven-plugin.html}this blog post}}
  for a more detailed explanation.

  This plugin starts a local MySQL server on
  <<<pre-integration-test>>> phase and shuts it down
  on <<<post-integration-test>>>.

  The plugin can work with any
  version of MySQL (including MariaDB). All you need to do, in order to
  point it to another version, is to provide a custom Maven dependency
  as a ZIP archive.

  {{{./usage.html}Usage}} page explains how to get it up and running.

  The plugin was tested with Maven 3.0.5 and 3.1.3 on:

   * Mac OS X 10.8.5

   * Windows 7 SP 1

   * Ubuntu Linux 12.04 Desktop

  If you use it somewhere else and it works for you, please let us know
  and we'll add your platform to this list.
  If you have problems, please submit an issue to
  {{{http://github.com/jcabi/jcabi-mysql-maven-plugin/issues}Github}}.
